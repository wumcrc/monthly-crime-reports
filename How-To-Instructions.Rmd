### Instructions for this R Project

#Step 1
If you have not already, download Libreoffice from https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/ this allows you to utilize the `docxtractr` package which converts powerpoints to PDFs.

#Step 2
Run the `data-creation.Rmd` at the beginning of each month. Check https://www.slmpd.org/crime_stats.shtml to see the last time the crime data has been updated. Download the appropriate file from this link and save it in the `Data` folder (make sure to save it in the correct year and month folder as well). Once you have checked to see that the data is available for the current month, the next step is to change the `params` of the `data-creation.Rmd`. 
          `month1` should be changed to the first three letters of the first month of the 2 month period    (crime data is currently reported in two month intervals i.e. Jan-Feb, Mar-Apr, etc.). 
          `month2` should be the first three letters of the second month of the 2 month period
          `year` should be set to the current year
Once you have changed all 3 of the params you can run the `data-creation.Rmd`. 

#Step 3
Once you have run the `data-creation.Rmd` you need to run the `fpse-bot-cwe-mc-presentation.Rmd`. Before you run this notebook, you need to change the params.  
          `year` should be set to the current year
          `month` should be changed to the current month
          `month1` should be set to the first three letters of the first month of the 2 month period
          `month2` should be the first three letters of the second month of the 2 month period
          `num` Num referes to the column of the current month. Because months come in pairs in this dataset, if the month is first (i.e. January in Jan-Feb, or March in Mar-Apr) then the num should be set to 2. If it comes second (i.e. Feb in Jan-Feb, or Apr in Mar-Apr) then num should be set to 3.
After you change all 5 params you can run this notebook. 

#Step 4
Now that you have run the `fpse-bot-cwe-mc-presentation.Rmd` you can run the `sdb-dbp-we-vp-presentation.Rmd` and `ac-fp-lp-vd-presentation.Rmd`. It is not important which one you run first, just be sure to change the params! They are the exact same as the params for the `fpse-bot-cwe-mc-presenation.Rmd`. 

#Step 5
CHECK THE FINAL RESULT! Make sure that the presentations look accurate. The most common mistake I have made is not changing the params, which results in an empty looking presentation because the data is wrong. So always make sure to check the final products!

#Step 6
Once you have double checked everything it is time to push everything to github! Because of how the code is written, everything (plots, tables, etc.) is saved separately in addition to the final presentation. The best way to push to github is to divide the commits as follows:
          Make one commit with all of the presentations, ex: Add November Reports
          Make a second commit with the updated .Rmd files, ex: Update Params for November
          Make a third commit with all remaining files which should only be the plots, tables and other files created and saved from the .Rmd, ex: Add November Results
          
#Step 7
After you have made those commits it is time to push them to Github! Congrats, you're all done!
