### Instructions for this R Project

#Step 1
Run the `data-creation.Rmd` at the beginning of each month. You can use `cs_last_update()` from the `compstatr` package to see when the crime data was last updated. Once you have checked to see that the data is available for the current month, the next step is to change the `params` of the `data-creation.Rmd`. 
          `month` should be changed to the current month
          `pastyear` should be kept at the previous year
          `year` should be set to the current year
          `ytd` should be set to January 1st of the current year
          `date` should be set to the first day of the current month
          `pastdate` should be set to January 1st of the previous year
          `pstdtmonth` should be set to the 1st of the current month, but of the previous year
          `pstdtmonth2` should be set to the last day of the current month of the previous year
Once you have changed all 8 of the params you can run the `data-creation.Rmd`. 

#Step 2
Once you have run the `data-creation.Rmd` you need to run the `fpse-bot-cwe-mc-presentation.Rmd`. Before you run this notebook, you need to change the params.  
          `month` should be changed to the current month
          `pastyear` should be kept at the previous year
          `year` should be set to the current year
          `date` should be set to the first day of the current month of the current year
          `pastdate` should be set to the first day of the current month of the previous year
After you change all 5 params you can run this notebook. 

#Step 3
Now that you have run the `fpse-bot-cwe-mc-presentation.Rmd` you can run the `sdb-dbp-we-vp-presentation.Rmd` and `ac-fp-lp-vd-presentation.Rmd`. It is not important which one you run first, just be sure to change the params! They are the exact same as the params for the `fpse-bot-cwe-mc-presenation.Rmd`. 

#Step 4
CHECK THE FINAL RESULT! Make sure that the presentations look accurate. The most common mistake I have made is not changing the params, which results in an empty looking presentation because the data is wrong. So always make sure to check the final products!

#Step 5
Once you have double checked everything it is time to push everything to github! Because of how the code is written, everything (plots, tables, etc.) is saved seperately in addition to the final presentation. The best way to push to github is to divide the commits as follows:
          Make one commit with all of the presentations, ex: Add November Reports
          Make a second commit with the updated .Rmd files, ex: Update Params for November
          Make a third commit with all remaining files which should only be the plots, tables and other files created and saved from the .Rmd, ex: Add November Results
          
#Step 6
After you have made those commits it is time to push them to Github! Congrats, you're all done!
